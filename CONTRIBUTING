# Contributing to this Project

The goals of all contributors is to give guidance to students who are on the CS/ECE track at CMU.
We want to give tips in a way that encourages learning and gives a student that is willing to
work hard a good chance at succeeding in the classes.

There can always be improvement made to articles. Therefore, don't be afraid to edit
articles that have already been written for classes.

Some guidelines:
 
 - Try to avoid saying things about professors, since they will change throughout the years
 - Also you can get in trouble for saying the wrong thing about professors, so best to avoid
 - Do not encourage cheating. If you must, you can always write problems of your own
