# Contributing to CMU ECE/CS Guide

The goal of all contributors is to give guidance to students who are on the CS/ECE track at CMU. We want to give tips in a way that encourages learning and gives students who are willing to work hard a good chance at succeeding in their classes.

There can always be improvement made to articles. Don't be afraid to edit articles that have already been written for classes.

## Guidelines

- **Avoid professor-specific commentary** - Professors change throughout the years, and you can get in trouble for saying the wrong thing
- **Do not encourage cheating** - If you want to provide practice problems, write problems of your own
- **Focus on helping students learn** - Give practical tips that help students succeed

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repo** - Committing directly to `master` is not allowed. Use the GitHub UI to create a fork (upper right hand corner)

2. **Make your changes** - If your changes are for a new class, add it to the `README.md` table of contents in the root directory

3. **Use markdown** - Please use markdown for all content. If you need additional assets like images or PDFs, create a new folder in the repo

4. **Open a pull request** - Submit a PR from your branch to the master branch. Once approved, you can merge it

## File Format

Each course file should follow this structure:

```markdown
# XX-XXX: Course Name

| Category | Difficulty |
|:--------:|:----------:|
| HW       | X          |
| Exams    | X          |

## What to expect
[Description of course structure, workload, etc.]

## How to do well
[Tips and strategies for success]

## What to watch out for
[Common pitfalls and challenges]

## Resources
[Links to textbooks, practice materials, etc.]
```

## Difficulty Ratings

Use a 1-10 scale for difficulty ratings:
- **1-3**: Easy, manageable workload
- **4-6**: Moderate difficulty
- **7-8**: Challenging, requires significant effort
- **9-10**: Very difficult, one of the hardest courses
