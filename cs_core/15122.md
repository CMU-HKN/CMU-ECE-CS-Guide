This class is designed to be taken after 15-112. This is an introductory programming course that introduces basic data structures and algorithms, and proofs to ensure correctness of computer programs. The course starts out in C0, which is a simplified version of C with inbuilt support for preconditions and postconditions. The course transitions to full C near the end. In addition to the 15-112 prerequisite, this course has a co-requisite of 21-127.

## What to expect

- **Homework:** There are two weekly homework assignments, written and programming. Written assignments are due on Mondays, and these assignments tend to cover proofs and more high-level details about data structures and algorithms. 
- **Exams:** There are two midterm exams and one final. The first has a greater emphasis on the proofs taught near to the beginning of the course, while the second has a greater emphasis on later lecture material, e.g. more data structures.

## How to do well

- Read the lecture notes. They are detailed and cover lecture content very completely. 
- Make sure to use good time management: the doubled weekly assignments can make it easy to miss a deadline for either the written or programming assignments.
- Read programming assignment writeups carefully. They are detailed, and many questions you may have on the homework can be answered by the writeup itself.
- Some units have extra review sessions on difficult topics, e.g. amortized analysis. Attend the review sessions if you find yourself struggling with the topic.

## What to watch out for

- The first exam tends to be particularly difficult for students. Most students do not have prior knowledge of writing proofs for computer science, and much of this exam is on proofs. Make sure to study and go to office hours and review sessions as necessary to understand this material.
- Students tend to do more poorly on written assignments than the programming assignments. For the written assignments, make sure to give very complete answers and ask questions in office hours as needed. 
- Make sure to follow the style guide. You can lose points after the fact for style, although the homework writeup will usually describe these penalties.
- The C0vm assignment is the culminating project of the course. It is generally more time-consuming, though not significantly more difficult, than other programming assignments. Make sure to practice good time management.
