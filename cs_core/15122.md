## General Expectations

- This course is very work heavy, so expect to commit a lot of time out of your week for 15-122. On lighter weeks, this course might require 8 hours, but on heavier weeks, expect to be working for 14+ hours on homework. These numbers vary for different students, so take that with a grain of salt.
- As in the syllabus, 5% of your grade is participation by showing up to lectures and labs. This is not a hard 5% to achieve, but definitely don’t skip labs early in the semester. This way, you have more leeway later in the semester to skip if any of your other classes are taking more time than usual.
- The lectures are very good, but if you are in the 8:35 time slot and have a hard time paying attention that early, consider reading the very detailed lecture notes that are on the course website.
- Recitations are super useful if you are confused about any information, but they are not necessary to attend to succeed in the class.

## Homeworks
- Programming assignments are typically due every Thursday, and written assignments are typically due every Monday.
- Office hours are held every day of the week to help students.

## Exams

- The exams are notoriously tricky, but a good measure of your understanding of the material.
- Historically, the first exam is the most challenging for students because they are not used to the types of proof-based questions that are on the exams. Additionally, students typically consider the exams tight on time, so keep that in mind when going into the exam room.

## Tips on succeeding
- As painful as this is, it is important to pay attention in lecture so you can complete the homework as fast as possible. Time is of the essence with two-deadline homework weeks, so this can shave off significant time every week working on homework if you really pay attention.
- Start the homeworks as early as possible! Particularly with the programmings it is important to start early. There are no office hours relating to the programming assignments on the day they’re due, so it is really important to start early to have ample opportunity to attend office hours if needed.
- Redo the writtens and recitations on top of doing the practice exams to study for the exams. The exam questions are very similar to what you see on writtens and recitations, and seeing as many problems as you can is extremely beneficial.
