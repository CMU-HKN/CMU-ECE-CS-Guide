# 18-100: Introduction to ECE

This is the intro class to the major.

For many, this is the first time you've had a legit class ever...
coming from high school. Good news is that 18-100 isn't _super_ difficult,
but it does cover a lot of material and isn't always taught the best,
so can be difficult for people who are learning about circuits and
electronics for the first time.

## Labs

The lab component of the class is 3 hrs at night where you get to
do some hands on labs with building, measuring, and analyzing circuits.

## How to do well

- Know how to do KCL fast and accurately
- Start HW early
- Go to lab early
- Understand lecture
- Practice lots of related material before the exam

## What to watch out for

- People underestimate how difficult the first exam can be, and might end up flunking. If you overprepare for the first exam, you can stay ahead of the curve.
- The labs involving digital logic can be hard since they are very large circuits
- It is easy to get stuck in lab when your circuit is messy and hard to debug. To make your life and the TA's life easier, try to build neat circuits -- but don't waste too much time making it too neat
