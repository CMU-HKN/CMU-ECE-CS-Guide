This class is the next big step for programming courses after 15-122, and is
arguably even more time consuming. That being said, 213 can be very rewarding,
as it gives students lots of great experience with complex programming projects
which can be valuable for students when applying for software internships.
The weekly homework assignments (called labs) are the bulk of the work, and are
what the course is built around.

## What to expect

- **Labs:** The labs are what define 213. They take a lot of time and are very involved
- **HW:** There is no additional homework aside from the weekly labs
- **Exams:** Are pretty challenging, but you have way more time than you need

## How to do well

- Skim over the book when you can - it follows along with lecture well b/c professor Bryant wrote it
- Start the assignments as soon as you can and ask for help at recitation
- Use the practice server for the exams - it's very similar to the real exams
- Save your late days for the later assignments like malloc and proxy

## What to watch out for

- If you get a bad TA for your recitation, it is definitely worth the trouble to switch sections. Recitation can be very helpful if you have the right TA
- The lectures can be really boring b/c they usually just go through slides
- If you think you have a creative way of doing one of the assignments in a different way, make absolutely sure that it will work because there's usually a preferred way for each assignment to be done
