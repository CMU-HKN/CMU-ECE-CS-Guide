This course builds up from the lower levels of computer hardware with
gates and boolean logic, to eventually cover higher levels of abstraction
such as CPU's and basic computer architecture.

This essentially bridges the gap between the physics of transistors and
the machine code that gets generated by compilers.

The main instructor is Bill Nace, who is one of the few Teaching _only_
professors at CMU. This means he's actually interesting in helping students
learn, and lectures can even feel like a lot of hand holding through the
material (which can actually be really nice). 

## What to expect

- **Lab:** In general, Labs aren't too stressful as long as you get
a good lab partner (they're randomly assigned) and it is highly recommended
that you get started before your actual lab time. Most people just come in
around 5 - 5:30 for their 6:30 labs and that sets them up nicely to
leave before 9:30.
- **HW:** Homeworks are good practice for the material, but can easily take up an entire day of your weekend (usually due on Mondays)
- **Exams:** There are 2 midterms and one final which is optional if you already have an A in the class. Exams are usually a bit of a time-crunch, but the practice exams are very helpful.

## How to do well

- Don't slack off in the beginning b/c this class is like one big snowball of topics building off of each other
- Always check Piazza - there are lots of clarifications on assignments that can save you a lot of time
- Go to lab early
- Pay attention in lecture (even if you think you already know it)
- Look at the homework before recitation

## What to watch out for

- It takes a while to go through the process for handing in Homeworks and Lab documents. Make sure to leave yourself extra time to figure this out
- Hardware Threading is known as one of the toughest topics
