## How to study for exams

One of the trickiest parts of the class is that there is a wide
breadth of material so it is hard to learn everything in depth.
For exams, it is important to know all your equations and algorithms.
Fortunately, you have a cheatsheet so you can put those on there!

In addition, you can also do other school's exams for extra practice on the topic.

## External materials for the class

The good news about ML is that it is a very widely taught course, so there are lots of good materials about it outside of CMU. The most notable source for ML education is Andrew Ng's CS229 course at Stanford. His course notes are great and his class has lots of great content.
