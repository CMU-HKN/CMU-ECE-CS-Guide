Computer Vision is offered both in spring and fall semesters. It is an intermediate
level course. It is preferred to have some background in Image and Video processing, but
not mandatory. 


## Course logistics

There are typically 5-6 assignments. Some offering of the course has project also as a 
requirement (Depends on the professor). 


## How to do well?

Assignments are a major part of the course and they are pretty hands on. It takes
a long to code and even longer to debug. Most assignments require a lot of extra 
reading. Debugging some of the issues can get very tricky, so TA office hours are crucial.
The assignments will have a minor theory portion, it is suggested to complete the 
theory part before starting the coding part. 

The theory required to complete the assignments are covered in class. So it is highly
recommended to attend classes regularly. 

## What to watch out for?

Do not underestimate any assignment. They are longer than they appear and takes more time to complete. 
It is almost next to impossible to get it right the first time. Some of the issues 
with the initial part of the coding will only appear when you put everything together.
It is hard to verify your work in every step of the assignment. So allocate enough time
for debugging. Make use of the TA office hours when you cannot figure out the mistake.
