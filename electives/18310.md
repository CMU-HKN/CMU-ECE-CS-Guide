This class covers the fundamentals of semiconductor devices, with an emphasis on the link between basic principles and device design. The course spans topics from semiconductor theory concepts to the future transistor designs.

## Lectures

The lectures introduce the concepts that you need to complete your assignments. It will also connect these concepts to practical applications in semiconductor design. You could probably do well in the class without attending lecture and simply referring to the slides, but going to lecture is a great opportunity to ask questions and definitely recommended if you are actually interested in the discipline.

Attending recitation is also recommended if you want to see practice problems worked through or if you want to ask questions.

There will also be a Canvas quiz after each lecture, combining for a small percentage of your grade. You don't actually have to do them during lecture, since they stay open well into the next day. Typically they cover some concept of the lecture

There is a textbook for the class ([available for free here](https://www.chu.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Chenming-Hu_ch1-3.pdf)), but the lectures don't necessarily precisely follow the book. If you want extra reading, you can ask the professor which section to refer to.

## Homeworks

Homework assignments are usually a set of 5-6 problems that use concepts from the previous lecture. Typically solving a homework problem boils down to finding the right equation from the lecture slides or the right diagram to model the problem. Sometimes it can be unclear what equation you should use/what the first step should be from a problem, but the professor is usually helpful on Piazza.

## Exams

There are three midterm exams in this class (no final exam). You are allowed a note sheet and you will probably be filling it up with equations and diagrams from the lecture slides. If you have a good note sheet, then the exams should be rather easy.
