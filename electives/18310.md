This course is the introductory elective to semiconductors and device physics.
Class content focuses on the underlying physics of semiconductor materials and
the basic devices that rely on their properties, such as diodes and
transistors, which in turn form the building blocks of the digital and analog 
electronics that power our world.

This class begins with the theory behind intrinsic and doped semiconductor 
materials and their properties, before moving on to diodes, transistors, and
other components. Students interested in taking this class should understand
that it focuses primarily on the (applied) physics of semiconductors, and
deep dives into the fundamental principles governing their properties, more
so than circuit analysis or design. On the other hand, it is also not a class
that goes too deep into theoretical physics - topics get tangential to
quantum mechanics, but mostly focus on the practical side of things, as they
pertain to IC design.

As a prerequisite to higher-level courses in device science, this is a 
must-take for students interested in this area. In addition, it makes a great
companion course for hardware or IC design classes, such as 18-320,
as understanding the principles of semiconductors can be helpful to
analyzing and designing circuits.

Lectures can be very dense, and the material is pretty mathematically
rigorous. Attending lectures is highly recommended, as it may be difficult
to make sense of graphs and equations outside of the lecture hall. Speaking
of graphs and equations, there are a _lot_ of them, as well as symbols
and constants. However, assignments are relatively easy, and are mostly
"plug and play" - find the right equation from lecture slides, and plug in
provided values. Exams are likewise.

This course is usually taught by Professor Jimmy Zhu, who has a wealth of
experience in this field and explains concepts in a really intuitive way.

## Topics Covered

- **Intrinsic and Doped Semiconductors**
- **Carrier Diffusion, Recombination, Mobility**
- **PN Junctions and Diodes**
- **BJTs**
- **MOSFETs**

## Tips

- Attend lectures. This is one of those classes where attending lectures and 
paying attention is a more effective and time-efficient way to learn the 
material, even for those who are confident of their ability to study it 
themselves
- _Make a good notesheet._ There are lots of equations and symbols, but exam
problems tend to relatively simple, in the sense that they often involve 
just finding the right equations and plugging in values. So the more equations
and graphs you have prepared, the more you'll breeze through exams
- In lectures, focus on getting an intuitive understanding of the concepts
being covered - why electrons and holes behave the way they do, what an
energy band diagram means, etc. Understanding concepts well will make
homework assignments and exam problems much easier
