This class is the next big step for computer security courses, and is
arguably very time consuming. The course cover both varios aspect of computer security. You will get exposed to content from research papers, and hand on experience from homework. I have t onote it her thought that the homework is an epic homework so you probably need to be familair with c to do well on this homework.

## What to expect

- **HW:** There is three homework. homework 2 have 3 parts, and homework 3 has two parts. It is going to feel like you have 6 homeworks. However, it can be fun, and worthwhile experience.
- **Exams:** There is three exam. It is very difficult. THe exam is going to be alway more advance from contect in the lecture so it is better to prepare for it and ask lots of questions in the lecture. Most of the question in pratice exams are not going to be in the final so do not trust the practice exam.

## How to do well

- I think the best stragy 
- Start the homework as soon as you can
- Do not spend too much time on homework 2 with compete with other students too much. It is fun but spending preparing for exam is a better use of time since that is where real competition happen.
- Ask lots of question on piazza, the instruction team is very responsive so you should leverage that. 
- Save your late days for the homework two since I think it is the most epic one.
- Do not take other hard course. You will probably need to about 15-20 hour a week to be excellent on this course.

## What to watch out for

- be careful on teammates on homework 2. Ask the instruction team to switch your team right away if your teammate is not responsive.

## For the overachiever
- Congratulation, this is probably the most advanced course in software system security.
