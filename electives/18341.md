This is the seminal class in the hardware systems track in ECE. Most students 
take this course shortly after 18-240 and before. This coure has no exams, and 
your grade is solely determined by how well you do on the projects. The level 
of difficulty of the projects vary wildly, ranging from something that can be 
done in a single evening to something that could take many, many days.

The homeworks are a lot like the homeworks that were in 18-240. They aren't 
super intellectually challenging, but take a fair bit of time to do them 
correctly. 

It's important to note that lectures aren't mandatory, and much of what you need 
to be able to complete the projects are in just a few of the lecture slides. That 
being said, Professor Nace put in a lot of time into making the lectures and they 
cover a lot of interesting topics. Additionally, the content from Professor Nace's 
lecture slides are chalk full of content used for hardware interviews. Additionally,
Professor nace tries to get a few guest lecturers to come in towards the end of the 
semester from some prominent companies.

If you're serious about learning how to use System Verilog professionally, the 
textbook is a worthwhile investment.

## Topic Covered
- **System Verilog**
- **Pipelining**
- **FSM+D Design and Implementation**
- **FPGA Synthesis**
- **Signal Tap**
- **Hardware Design**
- **VCS**
- **Industry Verification**

## What to expect

- **HW:** Similar to the 240 style of homeworks. Can range from short coding 
assignments to paper assignments you'll discuss in class. Again, these aren't super 
challenging, but they do take a lot of time. 

- **Labs:** Some of these labs are very time intesive. Additionally, for one of 
the labs (USB), you will be assigned a random partner from the class. They are 
mostly self-paced, so the onus is own yourself to make sure you stay on top of 
all the assignments and check ins. 

## How to do well

- Start the labs early
- Don't be afraid of the TAs. Nace usually vets them thoroughly
- Not impossible to do well, the grading scheme is quite forgiving

## What to watch out for

- Expect to spend a lot of time on this class
- This class is incredibly System Verilog intensive
