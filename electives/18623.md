This class provides an overview of analog integrated circuits, covering a number of IC designs and techniques at the transistor-level.

It covers MOSFET modes of operation, as well as its various applications. The class then shows a number of amplifier topologies and their use cases. It also covers the differential pair and the operational amplifier in great detail, among other topologies. It focuses on how to analyze and design analog circuits to meet certain specifications and constraints, showing the tradeoff between these goals.

Please note that this guide was written from Fall 2021; the assignments and material for the course may change slightly in future offerings of the course.

## Homeworks

You will have around 5-6 homeworks throughout the semester. They involve both conceptual questions which require you to work through circuits and calculations on paper, as well as some simulation-based problems. The homeworks can be challenging but, as with most classes, be sure to start early and utilize office hours. The textbook may also be very helpful to review relevant concepts, although it can be quite dense in its analysis.

The TAs will hold lab sessions on Fridays, some of which are dedicated to helping you out with the homework. Be sure to attend those, and come with lots of questions! That is a great time to get some clarification for the homework, as well as lecture concepts in general.

Ultimately, the homeworks have a lower weight on your grade, relative to the projects and exams. However, you should still give a good effort on them -- be sure to go back and learn what you did not understand fully when doing the homework. This will help you when it comes time to tackle the projects and exams.

## Exams

There are two exams in the course. The first exam covers roughly the first ten lectures, and the second exam covers roughly the next ten lectures (though the second exam depends upon material from the first).

The exams are very reflective of what is covered in the lectures and on the homeworks. As you go through each lecture, be sure to take notes on the different examples covered. Additionally, be sure to spend time reviewing the homeworks after you have completed them. Both will help prepare you for what is covered on the exams.

The exams are similar in weight as the projects for your grade, so it is advised to prepare well for them.

## Projects

The projects are the "meat" of this course. Through these projects, you will learn how to use Cadence for circuit simulation and layout, as well as how to approach an analog IC design task.
Consequently, you will likely spend a significant amount of time on the projects -- but hopefully, you will be learning through doing. You will be asked to meet a number of design specifications for both projects; the challenge comes in meeting all specifications, since there are often key tradeoffs in design.

The projects are done in pairs of two. Since you are working in Cadence, it can be tricky to divide responsibilities, but you should still be able to break the projects into subcomponents that you can both work on and then integrate.
Additionally, both projects will have a design review, which will allow you to get feedback on your approach before you begin your implementation. Use this time to get as much advice as possible!

You will have a few short lab sessions that will catch you up on the basics of Cadence simulation and layout. But you'll really start to become familiar with its tools through working on the projects.
Note that the projects are done over roughly the course of one month each. This may sound like a lot of time, but you will also have homeworks and exams in the course during this time - the earlier you start on the projects, the better!

### Project 1: Transimpedance Amplifier (TIA)

This project has you build a transimpedance amplifier, which is a current-to-voltage converter. The TIA is broken into three stages: an input stage to convert the input current to a voltage, a gain stage to amplify the voltage, and an output stage to provide a buffer for the output signal. You will also create biasing circuitry for the TIA, as well as testbenches to test each part of the circuit.

Interestingly enough, you may find the first project to be much more difficult than the second project. This is because you are likely still going to be learning the basics of Cadence, as well as developing your understanding of amplifier topologies.
Also, although you are given a basic topology for the TIA design, you will need to revise the design significantly in order to meet the desired specifications.

That said, this project lends itself well to a divide-and-conquer approach. You and your teammate can decide who takes each component of the TIA. Then, you can slowly put the pieces together.
Before you begin your work in Cadence, though, be sure to spend a large amount of time on the design. You should work out the different characteristics of your circuit before implementing it in Cadence. Use the design review to get good feedback from the professor and TAs.

### Project 2: Operational Amplifier (Op-Amp)

This project has you build an op-amp, which you have likely used as a building block in a larger circuit from earlier electronics classes. The op-amp is broken into two stages: a differential pair stage and a high-gain amplifier stage. Like the previous project, you will also create biasing circuitry for the op-amp; testbenches are also a good idea.

You may find this project to be a bit easier than the previous one. This is because by this point, you have learned the tools of Cadence.
Additionally, some of the lectures from the middle of the class actually step through how to design an op-amp to meet certain specifications. You should definitely use these slides as an aid in designing your own op-amp for this project.

Similar to the previous project, work with your teammate to split up portions of the design, test them individually, and then integrate together. You will also need to do layout for this project, but that should be saved for after you have finalized your simulations.
