## Machines

In this course we use a large variety of machines in the homeworks and projects:
- Large Linux servers with direct ssh access. The machines we access are the ECE number cluster and the data science cloud.
- Large number of small Linux machines in high throughput mode via ECE's HTCondor.
- HPC multicore nodes and multi-node configurations with and without GPUs via a batch system at PSC and CMU.
- Hadoop/Spark/Tensorflow with and without GPUs at PSC.
- Special hardware at PSC: Bridges AI multi-GPU resources (HPE Apollo and DGX-2) and large memory machines.
- AWS instances with or without multicore and GPU support.

## Software Platforms

In the course we try out a number of high-level languages and libraries in these languages:
- Python with NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib
- R with CRAN packages
- Matlab
- Mathematica
- Haskell
- Frameworks: Torch, Theano, OpenCV
- High-end engineering software
- C/C++ with HPC math/ML libraries

## Algorithms

We use algorithms covered in the lecture as simple examples to experiment across the machines and software platforms. Students either implement the algorithms themselves or find implementations online, and then run them on the target machines to perform scalability studies. Algorithm groups targeted in the homeworks are as following:
- Dense numerical linear algebra, CNNs/DNNs/FFTs
- Graph algorithms and sparse numerical linear algebra
- ODE and PDE solvers, stencils, filters, discretization
- Discrete and continuous optimization, ML training
- Informatics, symbolic computing, higher level AI algorithms
- Statistics: Monte Carlo, MCMC, statistical machine learning
- Deep Learning, Big Data Analytics

## Logistics

* Two lectures per week.
* No exams.
* Grading will be based on homeworks, blogpost, and class participation. 
* This class is traditionally offered in both Fall and Spring.

## Lectures

Taking into consideration the different backgrounds of the students in the lecture, the course is organized to gradual introduction for each topic.

## How to do well

- Pay attention to lectures and ask questions. 
- Attend the recitations every week, where the homeworks and the related concepts are well explained.
