In Spring 2022, this course was taught by Prof. Qu.

## Topics Covered

Some of the main topics covered here are

- **What is convex optimization**
- **Types of convex problems**
- **Dual problem formulation**
- **KKT Conditions**
- **Gradient Descent**
- **Stochastic Gradient Descent**
- **Proximal Gradient Descent**
- **Projected Gradient Descent (aka a lot of flavors of Gradient Descent)**
- **Barrier Problems**
- **Non-convex Optimization**

## Course logistics

There are 4 HWs and 2 midterms. The HWs are challenging, but not particularly long. You have roughly 10 days to 2 weeks for each. If you start early and go to OH, they're very maneagable. 
The midterms were given as 24hr take home tests. In general, they required around 3hrs each. These are not too hard but require that you've been keeping up with the class.

## How to do well

Attend classes regularly. Prof Qu also uses Canvas quizzes between classes. These are very useful for checking your own knowledge after each lecture. They can be a good hint that you need to review the lecture more.

Start the HWs early. They aren't too bad, but there is normally at least one question you won't fully get on the first try. It is useful to have a good start so you can get the most out of the office hours.

There are a lot of resources online for learning about Convex Optimization. The author of the textbook, Stephen Boyd, is a professor at Stanford and has his whole Optimization class posted on youtube. These can be really helpful for getting a different perspective if you're confused.
