The course covers the fault tolerance aspect of distributed systems. It's a course that scratches the surface of distributed systems: it talks about the concepts and analyzes real-world system failures. Some of the topics are: active and passive replication, logging, checkpointing, recovery, ACID vs BASE, and CAP theorem.

## Course logistics

- 30% Midterm Exam
- 40% Final Exam
- 30% Project

## What to expect

- **Project**: You are required to work in a group of 3 for the project. The project goal is to build a fault-tolerance system. There are multiple milestones and you are required to demo the them to the TA. During COVID the final demo is done in the format of video recording, but it's said that the professor will try to kill the program in several ways to test the fault-tolerance of the system.

- **Class**: There are a lot of in-class discussions and the course schedule is really flexible.

- **Exam**: The exams are open-book and open-notes. During COVID there are only multiple choice and fill in the blank questions.

## How to do well

- Attend the lectures and understand the concepts.
- Find some reliable teammates for the project as there are a lot of details in the implementation.
- Be careful about the wording of the exam questions.
