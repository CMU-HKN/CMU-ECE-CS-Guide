Game theory is a philosophy department course that served as the introduction to basic game theory. The main topics include Minimax Theory, Nash Equilibrium, Sequential Games, Bayesian Games, and Bargaining Theory. Scenarios include zero-sum games, auctions, votes, and sequantial games. Although the class informally assumes some knowledge about decision theory, it is a introductory class, and all of the decision theory part is easy to understand, as it is not in-depth. 

## Lectures
The lecture besically covers everything about the course material, and attending lectures would be sufficient to complete all homeworks. Lecture notes are provided beforehand (and enouraged to read before the lecture), but those are not in-depth explanations of the course materals bur rather concepts the lecture is going to use to solve some in-class examplar problems. At the last 60-30 minutes of the lecture, TA will typically take over and students will form small groups to discuss the model presented in the lecture.

## Homeworks
Homeworks are the only element that count as the grade in this course. Yes, this course do not have exams. Homeworks is typically composed of 3-4 problems that covers the topic of interest, and it is often a variant of the problems we solved in the class. There are about 5 homework throughout the semester, and each homework is equally distributed. 

## Textbooks
The textbook of this class is Osborne's **An Introduction to Game Theory**, which you can find in many sources. The lecture was build around the content of this book, and reading this book can be very helpful, expecially it is oftentimes assigned reading. If you are really interested at game theory, this book is going to be useful even after the class.
